  <h2>Empowered Women Empower Women</h2>
  
	<p>This has been my mantra and grounding concept as I have navigated through the business school. I have been so fortunate enough to find a community where I am able to grow professionally and personally. I believe in empowering others through a supportive network, technology, and perspective.</p>
        <p>I want to use this page to share my professional updates/information. The 3 topics that I will showcase are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Campus Experience</li>
    <li>Professional Experience</li>
    <li>Resume</li>
  </ul>
